# Taivo Agent Marketplace

A Git-based marketplace for reusable agent plugins and skills.

This repo is the place to publish and maintain useful agent capabilities across domains, not only public-data workflows. Current content includes the Estonia public sources package; future packages can include things like self-coaching, productivity, research, engineering, and other reusable agent systems.

## Distribution Targets

Each package can be distributed through:

1. Anthropic Claude Code plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + per-package plugin manifests).
2. Codex skill install from Git paths under `skills/.curated` or `skills/.experimental`.
