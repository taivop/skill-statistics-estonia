3.4. Statistical concepts and definitions
Age – the age of the person in full years at the time of the event, i.e. the age at last birthday. The age of children under 1 year of age is 0 years.
Citizenship – the particular legal bond between a person and his or her state, acquired by birth or naturalisation, whether by declaration, choice, marriage or other means according to national legislation
Country of permanent residence – the country where a person has continuously lived for at least 12 months, or where the person intends to live for at least 12 months
Country of birth –  mother's country of residence at the time of the birth of the child
Educational attainment – the highest level of education that an person has completed in the formal education system (general education school, vocational school, or university). Educational attainment is presented in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011).
Emigration – a person's departure from the place of residence; in the case of external migration, a person's departure from Estonia and settlement abroad; in the case of internal migration, a person's departure from one administrative unit, settlement unit, or settlement region in Estonia to another
Ethnic nationality – a person's belonging to an ethnic group based on self-determination of the person. A child’s ethnic nationality is determined by the parents; if a child’s (aged 0–17) ethnic nationality is not available in the population register, the mother’s ethnic nationality is assigned to the child
External migration – change of place of residence across the border of Estonia. The place of residence at the beginning and end of the year is compared.
Immigration – the arrival of a person at a place of residence. In the case of external migration, arrival in Estonia from a foreign country; in the case of internal migration, arrival from an administrative unit, settlement unit or settlement region in Estonia.
Legal marital status – persons aged 15 years and over are divided by (legal) marital status as follows:
- never been legally married – a person who has never been legally married;
- legally married – a person whose marriage is legal and has not terminated due to spouse’s death or divorce; A person can also be legally married if he or she does not live with the spouse. Only a marriage between a man and a woman is considered legal in this context;
- divorced – a person whose (previous) legal marriage terminated due to registration of divorce and who has not entered into a new legal marriage;
- widowed – a person whose (previous) legal marriage terminated due to death of the spouse (incl. being declared dead in court) and who has not entered into a new legal marriage.
Life expectancy – the mean additional number of years that a person of a given age can expect to live, if subjected throughout the rest of his or her life to the current mortality conditions. At the age of 0 – the life expectancy at birth (see also the definition of “life table”).
Life table – a numerical model (table of numerical values of age-dependent functions) which measures through interrelated indicators the mortality level in a certain period
Migration – change of place of residence from one unit to another. In migration, a distinction is made between moves from one country to another, one county to another, across borders of urban settlements within municipality and across borders of settlement regions.
Mean annual population – arithmetic mean of the population number at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year (beginning of the next year), rounded to a whole number. Used in the calculation of rates associated with vital events during a year.
Natural increase – the difference between the number of live births and deaths during one year. Natural increase is positive when the number of live births is larger than the number of deaths and negative when number of deaths exceeds the number of births.
Net migration – difference in the number of immigration and emigration events
Origin – the division of Estonia's populace into native and foreign-origin population.
- Native population – permanent residents of Estonia with at least one parent and at least one grandparent born in Estonia.
- Foreign-origin population – permanent residents of Estonia who do not belong to the native population. Foreign-origin population is divided into three categories:
- first generation of foreign-origin population – permanent residents of Estonia who and whose parents were born abroad;
- second generation of foreign-origin population – permanent residents of Estonia who were born in Estonia but whose parents were born abroad;
- third generation of foreign-origin population – permanent residents of Estonia with at least one parent born in Estonia, but all grandparents born abroad.
Place of residence – the area or settlement where the person lives permanently or most of the time
Settlement region – a territorial unit consisting of settlements with the same population density. Settlement regions are divided into city settlement regions, town settlement regions, and rural settlement regions based on population density and population figure. In the case of a division into two, city and town settlement regions are added.
- City settlement region – a type of settlement (a city, town, or village) where most inhabitants live in regions with population density greater than 1,000 inhabitants per km² and where the population figure in a cluster of such density is greater than 5,000 inhabitants.
- Rural settlement region – a type of settlement (a city, town, or village) where population density is lower than 200 inhabitants per km² or a region with higher population density where the population figure is under 5,000 inhabitants.
- Town settlement region – a type of settlement (a city, town, or village) where most inhabitants live in regions with population density of 200–1,000 inhabitants per km² and where the population figure in a cluster of this density is greater than 5,000, but it does not constitute a city settlement region.
Source country – immigrant's previous country of residence

Crude rates:
age-specific fertility rate – the number of live births per 1,000 women in the same age group per year (based on mean annual population);
age-specific death rate – the number of deaths per 1,000 inhabitants of a specific age group per year (based on mean annual population);
general fertility rate – the number of live births per 1,000 women aged 15–49 per year (based on mean annual population);
crude birth rate – the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants per year (based on mean annual population);
crude death rate – the number of deaths per 1,000 inhabitants per year (based on mean annual population);
crude rate of natural increase – the difference between the number of live births and the number of deaths per 1,000 mean annual population. Calculated as the difference between the crude birth rate and the crude death rate;
standardised death rate – a death rate calculated using an internationally agreed standard age-sex distribution to eliminate the effect of the population's actual age-sex distribution on mortality indicators. Until 2014, the age-sex distribution of the European Standard Population (published in 1976) was used. Since then, the standard age-sex distribution published in 2013 has been used.

3.5. Statistical unit
Person – for all population data tables;
events – for data tables of vital events (live births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and migration).
3.6. Statistical population
Usually resident population of Estonia
According to Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 on European demographic statistics, articles 2(c) and 2(d), ‘usually resident population’ means all persons having their usual residence in Estonia at the reference time. 'Usual residence’ is the place where a person normally spends the daily period of rest, regardless of temporary absences for purposes of recreation, holidays, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment, or religious pilgrimage. The following persons alone shall be considered to be usual residents of a specific geographical area:
- those who have lived in their place of usual residence for a continuous period of at least 12 months before the reference time; or
- those who arrived in their place of usual residence during the 12 months before the reference time with the intention of staying there for at least one year.
Usually resident population is determined using the residency index – a methodology based on the sign-of-life approach. More information:
Implementation of the residency index in demographic statistics
.
Usually resident population includes all population groups with enough of the so-called signs of life during the reference year. This includes people without a permanent address (e.g. the homeless), asylum seekers, refugees, and people under temporary protection.

7. Confidentiality
7.1. Confidentiality - policy
The dissemination of data collected for the production of official statistics is based on the requirements laid down in §§ 32, 34, 35 and 38 of the Official Statistics Act.
At European level, § 5 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out common principles and guidelines for ensuring the confidentiality of data used for the production of statistics and for access to confidential data.
7.2. Confidentiality - data treatment
The dissemination of data collected for the production of official statistics is based on the requirements laid down in §§ 34 and 35 of the Official Statistics Act. The principles for treatment of confidential data can be found
here
.
Publishing detailed population data carries the risk of unintentionally revealing personal information, such as identifying a single 40–44-year-old man in a specific village. Confidentiality methods must be applied to avoid this. Since 2022, Estonia has implemented a tailored version of the Eurostat-recommended cell key method, which generates random keys for individuals to introduce small variations while maintaining consistency across different tables. The method applies additive random noise to population data at municipality or settlement level in order to protect individuals' privacy. This statistical disclosure control method modifies dataset values slightly, ensuring confidentiality while preserving data usability. Consequently, row totals may not always match the overall total, but these discrepancies are minimal, typically amounting to only a few units. Approximately 15–25% of table frequencies are modified, with an average difference of 2. Half of the adjusted values have a difference of less than 25, and 25% have a difference of less than 5. These measures strike a careful balance between providing detailed statistical information and safeguarding individual confidentiality.
The confidentiality methodology is not applied to data presented at the national or county level. The raw data is not modified.

Description of the 2021 register-based census methodology
The total population frame, as well as the methodologies and data sources used for compiling information on individuals are the same in population statistics as in the 2021 register-based census. The methodology for defining the total population frame, as described in the document, has been used in population statistics since 2016 (see also: Implementation of the residency index in demographic statistics), while the methodology for determining the place of usual residence has been applied since 2022 (see also: Implementation of the partnership and location index in demographic statistics). The methodology and data sources for calculating other individual characteristics have evolved somewhat over the years, but since 2022, they have been the same as those described in the 2021 register-based census methodology document.

11. Quality management
11.1. Quality assurance
To assure the quality of processes and products, Statistics Estonia applies the European Statistics Code of Practice and the Quality Assurance Framework of the European Statistical System (ESS QAF). Statistics Estonia is also guided by the EFQM Excellence Model and the requirements in § 7 “Principles and quality criteria of producing official statistics” of the Official Statistics Act.
11.2. Quality assessment
Statistics Estonia performs all statistical activities according to an international model (Generic Statistical Business Process Model – GSBPM). According to the GSBPM, the final phase of statistical activities is overall evaluation using information gathered in each phase or sub-process; this information can take many forms, including feedback from users, process metadata, system metrics, and suggestions from employees. This information is used to prepare the evaluation report which outlines all the quality problems related to the specific statistical activity and serves as input for improvement actions.
Quality is managed by the quality manager.

12.2. User satisfaction
Since 1996, Statistics Estonia has conducted reputation and user satisfaction surveys. All results are available on the website of Statistics Estonia in the section
User surveys
. The survey referred to does not concern a specific statistical activity but is a general satisfaction survey.
12.3. Completeness
The data are complete and in line with Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Optional indicators have also been published and transmitted to Eurostat.
13. Accuracy and reliability
13.1. Overall accuracy
The quality of population data is good. The data are obtained from state registers and other sources, with information combined from over 18 sources. This approach ensures that the proportion of missing values in breakdowns is relatively small. Missing values are mainly due to missing information in the available sources but can be reduced as new data sources become available. Asylum seekers, refugees, and persons under temporary protection are included in the data.
13.2. Sampling error
Not applicable as population statistics is based on administrative data.
13.3. Non-sampling error
Not applicable as population statistics is based on administrative data.
14. Timeliness and punctuality
14.1. Timeliness
The preliminary population figure is published at the latest 23 days after the end of the reference year (T + 23 days). The revised and mean annual population and some sections are published 140 days after the end of the reference year (T + 140 days). All revised population data are published 250 days after the end of the reference year (T + 250 days).
14.2. Punctuality
The release schedule is available to users. The data have been published at the time announced in the release calendar.
15. Coherence and comparability
15.1. Comparability - geographical
The data are comparable with those of other European Union countries that produce population statistics on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Population data by counties have been published since 1990. The county borders have changed twice. The data indicate this in the years 1999–2000, when Lääne-Viru county increased and Järva county decreased. The change actually took place in 2005, but in the process of recalculations made between the censuses, it shifted to the census year – 2000. Another change was connected with the administrative reform of 2017, when the borders of most counties changed. Recalculations according to the new administrative division have been made to the population numbers as at 01.01.2015 (2015 data are calculated using index-based methodology, earlier data are based on the 2011 Population and Housing Census and on event statistics).
Municipal population figures have been published in current statistics since 2000. Changes in municipal borders in 2000–2011 were recalculated based on the borders at the time of the census because the interim period data were recalculated. Since 2012, the statistics of the merged municipalities are not comparable, because if the name of the municipality did not change, the data series of this municipality continued in the database. In order to deal with these changes, an overview of EHAK (Classification of Estonian administrative units and settlements) should be used. As of 2015, all data have been recalculated as of the new administrative reform of 2017. Another important event in terms of geographical comparability is the transition of methodology in 2015 from the place of residence indicated in the census to the use of the place of residence recorded in the Population Register. Starting from year 2022, place of residence is calculated using an index-based approach, where the residence address(es) reported in various state registers and the locations related to everyday activities (school, kindergarten, workplace, etc.) are used to determine the place of residence with which a person and his or her family members have been most closely associated in the year preceding the reference date.
15.2. Comparability - over time
Before 2012, population statistics was based on the population census, and births, deaths and changes of residence (migration) were added each year between the censuses. After the next census, the intermediate years’ data were recalculated according to reality.
Since the 2000 population census, the census data have been supplemented by under-coverage – the recalculations yielded the revised population number on 1 January 2000, which was 31,200 persons higher than the number of persons enumerated. As this was only done after the 2011 census and the previous period (1989–1999) has not been recalculated, there is a leap in the data compared with 1999 and 2000 due to the methodology. The population of 2012 is the population of the 2012 census, which has been supplemented by 30,760 persons due to the under-coverage.
Since 1 January 2012, population statistics is based on persons: only the events (birth, death, and change of residence) of usual residents of Estonia are added to the population statistics at the beginning of the year.
Starting from 1 January 2015, Statistics Estonia has conducted population analyses based on a new method, i.e. the residency index. The transition indicated that according to the new methodology, there were 1,599 more people living in Estonia at the time and the population therefore increased slightly. This was not due to the events of one year, but these persons had migrated to Estonia after the census (see also:
Implementation of the residency index in demographic statistics
.
15.3. Coherence - cross domain
Information about all vital events is collected on the same basis, so a cross-sectoral analysis is possible.
15.4. Coherence - internal
The data are internally coherent, i.e. all the data in a unit are consistent with each other. The internal coherence of the data is ensured through the use of a common methodology for data collection and aggregation.
16. Cost and burden
Population and vital events statistics are derived from administrative sources, therefore there is no burden on the respondents.
17. Data revision
17.1. Data revision - policy
The data revision policy and notification of corrections are described in the section
Principles of dissemination of official statistics
of the website of Statistics Estonia.
17.2. Data revision - practice
In January, the preliminary population count as of 1 January is published, based on the previous year's initial data on births, deaths, and registered migration.
The updated population figure, calculated using the residency index methodology, is published in April. The preliminary population count is replaced with the revised one.
For other indicators, data may be revised if the methodology is modified, errors are discovered, or new or better data become available.
The updated outputs in the statistical database are labelled with the new publication date, and the details of the update are provided in the notes added to the data table.

18.3. Data collection
Administrative data are received via X-Road, an FTP-server, and by email.
Upon receipt of the data, pseudonymisation is performed immediately to ensure the security of data processing and the protection of personal data.
Subsequently, data checks and validation are performed to identify potential deficiencies or errors and to ensure the quality and reliability of the data.
For more information on data validation, see S.18.4 Data validation.
18.4. Data validation
Data are validated in two stages: first, the quality of input data is checked and then the output is assessed.
In the first stage, the quality of input data received from various sources (see S.18.1. Data sources) is assessed. This involves measuring the percentage of missing data for each topic to identify potential gaps. Qualitative controls are also applied to detect logical errors and ensure the data are consistent with expected patterns.
In the second stage, the compiled aggregate output statistics are validated. Topic-specific results are compared with data from previous periods to identify inconsistencies or unusual trends. Where possible, results are cross-referenced with survey-based data sources, such as the Labour Force Survey or the 2011 population census.
18.5. Data compilation
Principles of data processing:
- The population is formed at person level, applying a specific method (residency index) to data in various registers. The residency index is used to find the probability of residing in Estonia for each person. The features necessary to identify each person are found by using the different registers in a specific priority order.
- When multiple data sources are used for a particular topic, they are applied in a specific priority order, which is defined separately for each subject.
- Document-based data sources are preferred to statement-based ones.
- For certain topics, age checks are performed when assigning information from data sources. For example, age checks are applied to education data, which means that if the level of education reported in the source is inconsistent with the person’s age, this information is disregarded.

Description of the 2021 register-based census methodology
18.6. Adjustment
Two models are used in population statistics: the residency index and the partnership and location index. The first determines the usually resident population, while the second defines the place of usual residence in Estonia. Both models are used to ensure compliance with the definitions in Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013.
Implementation of the residency index in demographic statistics
According to Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 on European demographic statistics, articles 2(c) and 2(d), the following persons shall be considered to be usual residents of a specific geographical area:
- those who have lived in their place of usual residence for a continuous period of at least 12 months before the reference time; or
- those who arrived in their place of usual residence during the 12 months before the reference time with the intention of staying there for at least one year.
The residency index is used to assess the probability of each person residing in Estonia. The necessary features to identify each person are extracted from various registers in a specific priority order. A more detailed description of the model can be found in Section 3.6. Statistical Population. This model has been applied in population statistics since 2016.
An alternative register-based (i.e. not survey-based) approach would be to define usually resident population as the population registered in the Population Register. However, this would lead to an underestimation of migration in annual population statistics, as a significant amount of immigration and emigration is not registered in the Population Register. This includes individuals who move abroad but do not update their address in the Population Register and those who move to Estonia but fail to register their residence.
Implementation of the partnership and location index in demographic statistics
According to Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 on European demographic statistics, articles 2(c) and 2(d), ‘usual residence’ is the place where a person normally spends the daily period of rest, irrespective of temporary absences for purposes such as recreation, holidays, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment, or religious pilgrimage.
In Estonian population statistics, usual residence is the (habitable) dwelling with which a person and their family members were most strongly associated during the reference period (the year prior to the reference date). The association with dwellings is calculated based on the addresses reported in various state registers and the locations related to daily activities (such as school, kindergarten, workplace, etc.). If a person has a family, all family members share a common usual residence. For a single person, the usual residence is considered to be the habitable dwelling with which the person had the strongest connection during the previous year. The partnership and location index has been used in population statistics since 2022.
An alternative register-based (i.e. not survey-based) approach would be to define usual residence as the place of residence recorded in the Population Register. However, it is well known that many people do not actually live at their registered address. Since usual residence also serves as the basis for dwelling-based household statistics (persons living at the same address form one household), using only registered addresses would distort household and family statistics, as well as population distribution data. Studies conducted in preparation for the 2021 census showed that lone-parent households would be most affected, as family members may be registered at different addresses (e.g. a summer house or a second home).
A survey conducted in 2018 assessed the quality of both models. The results are available here:
