# Estonia Government Public Sources

## Use when
- You need fast, evidence-backed answers about how Estonian government operates or has operated.
- You need to identify the right official source for governance, legal, policy, spending, registry, oversight, or municipal questions.

## Avoid when
- You already know the exact source skill and can open it directly.

## What the user gets
- A fast path to the best official source for the question.
- Source-specific workflows that produce structured, traceable outputs.
- Manual fallback guidance when a source needs user interaction (login/export/captcha), then continued automated analysis from user-provided files.

## Routing workflow
1. Classify the user request (parliament, government operations, justice, business/asset registry, finance, municipal, etc.).
2. Use the high-level index below to narrow to a source family.
3. Open `SOURCE_MAP.md` for precise source-to-question routing.
4. Open the specific `sources/<source-name>/SKILL.md` and execute that workflow.
