# Plant Protection Supervision

## Use when
- You need official plant protection supervision and compliance context.
- You need structured extraction of plant protection oversight materials.

## Avoid when
- You need only high-level environmental indicators.

## Inputs
- Topic scope, period, and regulated activity type.

## Outputs
- Structured plant protection supervision references and findings fields.

## Primary endpoints
- Plant protection: https://pta.agri.ee/en/plants/plant-protection

## Workflow
1. Identify relevant plant protection supervision content.
2. Extract requirements, checks, and outcomes fields.
3. Normalize category labels.
4. Return structured output and caveats.

## Human setup (when needed)
- If key details are in linked docs/forms, guide user through retrieval and continue from those files.

## Quality checks
- Distinguish requirement text from observed outcomes.
- Keep legal references associated with each item.
