# National Archives Governance Records

## Use when
- You need historical records of government operation.
- You need archival context for longitudinal governance analysis.

## Avoid when
- You need current operational dashboards only.

## Inputs
- Institution/topic, historical period, record type.

## Outputs
- Archival record references with metadata and source links.

## Primary endpoint
- Archives overview: https://www.ra.ee/en/archives/

## Workflow
1. Locate relevant archival collections by institution/topic.
2. Extract collection/item references and date ranges.
3. Capture access metadata and links.
4. Return curated archival reference set.

## Human setup (when needed)
- If archival records require manual search portal navigation, walk user through search steps and continue from shared result links.

## Quality checks
- Preserve archive reference IDs and date spans.
- Distinguish digitized records from catalog-only entries.
