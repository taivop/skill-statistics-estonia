# Ombudsman Opinions and Reports

## Use when
- You need oversight/rights interpretation context from the Chancellor of Justice.
- You need annual reports and initiative outputs.

## Avoid when
- You need court judgments rather than ombudsman materials.

## Inputs
- Topic keywords, rights area, and period.

## Outputs
- Report/opinion references with metadata and links.

## Primary endpoint
- Annual reports: https://www.oiguskantsler.ee/en/opinions-and-initiatives/annual-reports

## Workflow
1. Collect report/opinion entries by period and topic.
2. Extract publication metadata and links.
3. Summarize relevant oversight themes.
4. Return structured source list.

## Human setup (when needed)
- If specific subpages are language-dependent, walk user through switching language/filtering and continue from shared URLs.

## Quality checks
- Distinguish formal reports from explanatory news posts.
- Preserve exact publication year/date.
