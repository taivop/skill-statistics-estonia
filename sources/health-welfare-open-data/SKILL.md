# Estonia Health/Welfare Open Data (TEHIK)

## Use when
- You need administrative health or welfare datasets listed by TEHIK.
- You need source routing from catalog to downloadable datasets.

## Avoid when
- You need only TAI statistical tables.

## Inputs
- Topic and needed granularity.

## Outputs
- Curated dataset shortlist and direct access links.

## Primary endpoint
- TEHIK open data page: https://teabekeskus.tehik.ee/et/avaandmed

## Workflow
1. Identify relevant TEHIK-listed datasets.
2. Follow through to actual file/API endpoints.
3. Assess metadata completeness and update cadence.
4. Return recommended primary dataset and backup options.

## Human setup (when needed)
- If the catalog links to portals requiring manual interaction, give exact click path and request the final file or URL.

## Quality checks
- Check legal/privacy notes on each dataset.
- Verify that aggregation level matches the user request.
