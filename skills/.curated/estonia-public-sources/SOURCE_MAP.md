## Routing notes

- Prefer source-specific skills over generic discovery when user intent is clear.
- Use `sources/open-data` first when the user gives only a vague topic.
- If a source is UI-only or access-controlled, pick the skill that includes human-guided export steps and continue from user-provided files.
