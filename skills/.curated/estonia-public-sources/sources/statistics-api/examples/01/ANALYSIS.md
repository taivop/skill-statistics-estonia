## Detailed Analysis

### Cumulative Distribution Insights

The cumulative distribution chart reveals several important patterns:

1. **Consistent Gap**: At every income percentile, male earnings exceed female earnings. This indicates systemic differences in compensation rather than isolated disparities.

2. **Widening Gap at Higher Incomes**: The absolute difference in earnings increases substantially at higher income levels. While the 10th percentile shows a difference of €0.94/hour, the 90th percentile shows a difference of €4.78/hour - a 5x increase.

3. **Distribution Shape**: Both distributions show similar shapes, suggesting that the wage structure (in terms of dispersion) is comparable for both genders, but with females earning less at equivalent percentiles.

4. **Median Comparison**: The median female worker (€8.78/hour) earns approximately the same as a male worker at the 30th percentile (€8.47/hour), indicating that the typical female worker must be in the bottom third of the male earnings distribution.

### Comparison with European Context

According to Eurostat data, the unadjusted gender pay gap in the EU averaged around 12-13% in recent years. Estonia's gender pay gap of 17.5% (at the median) is **above the EU average**, suggesting room for improvement in gender pay equity.

### Factors Contributing to the Gender Pay Gap

While this analysis focuses on the distribution of earnings, the gender pay gap is typically attributed to several factors:

1. **Occupational segregation**: Men and women tend to work in different occupations and industries
2. **Part-time work**: Women are more likely to work part-time (though this data includes both full-time and part-time workers)
3. **Career interruptions**: Women are more likely to take career breaks for caregiving
4. **Education and experience**: Differences in educational fields and work experience
5. **Negotiation and discrimination**: Differences in salary negotiation and potential discrimination

**Note**: This analysis presents the *unadjusted* gender pay gap, which does not account for differences in occupation, education, experience, or other factors. An adjusted analysis controlling for these factors would provide additional insights.

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths
- Official statistics from Statistics Estonia with rigorous methodology
- Comprehensive coverage of Estonian enterprises, institutions, and organizations
- Standardized definitions aligned with EU regulations
- Regular updates (annually in October)

### Limitations
1. **Aggregated Data**: This analysis uses data aggregated across all occupations. Occupation-specific analysis might reveal different patterns.
2. **Unadjusted Gap**: The analysis does not control for factors such as education, experience, occupation, or hours worked.
3. **Point in Time**: Data represents a snapshot from October 2022 and may not reflect year-round variations.
4. **Exclusions**: Quarterly bonuses, annual bonuses, and other irregular payments are excluded from earnings.

## Conclusions and Insights

### Main Conclusions

1. **Persistent Gender Pay Gap**: A significant gender pay gap exists across all income levels in Estonia, with females earning 16.5% to 23.6% less than males at equivalent percentiles.

2. **Increasing Gap at Higher Incomes**: The gap widens at higher income levels, suggesting that gender disparities may be more pronounced in higher-paying positions or among higher earners.

3. **Absolute vs. Relative Gap**: While the percentage gap varies, the absolute euro difference increases dramatically at higher income levels (from €0.94 to €4.78 per hour).

4. **Median Disparity**: The median female worker earns €1.86/hour (17.5%) less than the median male worker, translating to approximately €298 less per month (assuming 160 hours/month).

### Implications

**For Policy Makers:**
- Consider policies to address gender pay equity, particularly at higher income levels
- Investigate factors contributing to the widening gap at higher percentiles
- Monitor progress over time using this cumulative distribution methodology

**For Employers:**
- Review compensation structures for gender equity
- Ensure transparent and fair salary determination processes
- Address potential barriers to women's advancement to higher-paying positions

**For Researchers:**
- Further analysis needed to understand occupation-specific gaps
- Investigation of factors contributing to the expanding gap at higher income levels
- Longitudinal analysis to track changes over time

### Future Analysis Opportunities

1. **Occupation-Specific Analysis**: Examine gender pay gaps within specific occupations to control for occupational segregation
2. **Industry Analysis**: Analyze gaps across different economic sectors
3. **Education Level**: Compare gaps by educational attainment
4. **Age Groups**: Examine how the gap varies across different age cohorts
5. **Regional Analysis**: Compare gaps across Estonian counties
6. **Trend Analysis**: Track changes in the distribution over multiple years
