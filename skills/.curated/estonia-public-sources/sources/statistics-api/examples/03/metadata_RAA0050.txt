11.1. Quality assurance
To assure the quality of processes and products, Statistics Estonia applies the EFQM Excellence Model, the European Statistics Code of Practice and the Quality Assurance Framework of the European Statistical System (ESS QAF). Statistics Estonia is also guided by the requirements in § 7. “Principles and quality criteria of producing official statistics” of the Official Statistics Act.
11.2. Quality assessment
Statistics Estonia performs all statistical activities according to an international model (Generic Statistical Business Process Model – GSBPM). According to the GSBPM, the final phase of statistical activities is overall evaluation using information gathered in each phase or sub-process; this information can take many forms, including feedback from users, process metadata, system metrics and suggestions from employees. This information is used to prepare the evaluation report which outlines all the quality problems related to the specific statistical activity and serves as input for improvement actions.
12. Relevance
12.1. User needs
Ministry of Finance
Association of Municipalities of Estonia
Economic activity analysis of counties and regional units; development plans and policy formulation; preparation of economic studies, research and analysis; dissemination of statistical information
12.2. User satisfaction
Since 1996, Statistics Estonia has conducted reputation and user satisfaction surveys. All results are available on the website of Statistics Estonia in the section
User surveys
.
12.3. Completeness
The calculation of the regional gross domestic product (RGDP) is in compliance with the requirements of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) methodology.
13. Accuracy and reliability
13.1. Overall accuracy
The accuracy of the national accounts depends on the quality of the input data from statistical activities. The accuracy of input data from statistical activities is checked.
13.2. Sampling error
Not applicable
13.3. Non-sampling error
Eurostat and the national statistical institutes try to reduce non-sampling errors by continuous methodological and survey process improvements.
14. Timeliness and punctuality
14.1. Timeliness
The data are published 365 days after the end of the reference year (T + 365).
14.2. Punctuality
The data have been published at the time announced in the release calendar.
15. Coherence and comparability
15.1. Comparability - geographical
The geographical comparability of national accounts in Member States of the European Union is ensured by the application of common definitions of the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). Worldwide geographical comparison is also possible as most non-European countries apply the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) guidelines, and SNA 2008 is consistent with ESA 2010.
The regional breakdown follows the NUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) classification.
15.2. Comparability - over time
The data of the whole time series of regional gross domestic product (RGDP) are comparable since 1995.
15.3. Coherence - cross domain
Within the system of national accounts there is full consistency between the domains: regional national accounts, annual and quarterly accounts, sector accounts, financial accounts, regional accounts, supply and use tables. However, in practice full consistency may not always be possible and temporary discrepancies might occur. They are usually the result of vintage differences.
Primary statistics like structural business statistics (SBS), short term statistics (STS) and labour force statistics (LFS) are widely used as input for national accounts. However, there is no full consistency between these statistical domains and national accounts. Main reasons are differences in concepts/definitions and in coverage (e.g. regional distribution).
Balance of payments is also used as an important source for national accounts. The definitions and coverage of balance of payments, as defined in the BPM6 manual, are fully harmonised with those in ESA 2010. Therefore, balance of payments variables are in principle fully coherent with the corresponding national accounts variables.
15.4. Coherence - internal
Within the system of national accounts there is full consistency between the domains: regional national accounts, annual and quarterly accounts, government accounts, sector accounts, financial accounts, supply and use tables. However, in practice full consistency may not always be possible and temporary discrepancies might occur. They are usually the result of vintage differences.
