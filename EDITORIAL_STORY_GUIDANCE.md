# Editorial Story Guidance (From User Direction)

## Core standard
- Pursue stories that are meaningful for society or policy, not clickbait.
- Apply timeless journalistic standards for substance, structure, and style.
- Think like an editor-in-chief: evaluate impact, evidence strength, novelty, public value, fairness, and execution risk together.

## How to think before pitching
- Do reporting work before pitching: test whether a real angle exists in data/documents.
- Do not pitch speculative ideas without evidence signals.
- Think broadly across beats, not only one domain or only dry technical angles.
- Prioritize stories with clear public consequence and realistic accountability targets.

## Story selection criteria
- Public-interest impact: who is affected, how much, and how directly.
- Evidence viability: official records exist and can support defensible claims.
- Originality: not saturated by prior media unless new evidence materially advances understanding.
- Accountability: identifiable institutions/people can answer specific questions.
- Actionability: story can inform policy choice, oversight, or citizen decisions.

## Story structure expectations
- Strong, concrete lede with documented facts.
- Nut graf that explains why the pattern matters now.
- Transparent method and limits.
- Human stakes, not only data tables.
- Fair right-of-reply framing built into reporting plan.

## Operating rule for future pitches
- For each proposed story, include:
  1. Verified signal already found,
  2. Why this matters for people/policy,
  3. What is still unknown,
  4. Specific next reporting steps,
  5. Kill criteria (what would make this story not worth pursuing).
