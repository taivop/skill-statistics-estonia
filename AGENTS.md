# Project Agent Notes

For overall project purpose and structure, read `/Users/taivo/repos/skill-statistics-estonia/README.md` first.

## Source Inclusion Criteria

Include a new source skill only when it meets all of these:

1. Official and authoritative.
2. Publicly accessible in practice (API, download, or stable UI flow).
3. Governance-relevant records (operations, decisions, spending, enforcement, registries, oversight, or service delivery).
4. Repeatable workflow that an LLM can execute reliably.
5. Non-duplicate coverage versus existing source skills (extend existing skills instead of creating duplicates).

Exclude by default:

1. News/PR pages without durable records.
2. Sources where useful data is mostly non-public.
3. Highly unstable sources with low reuse value.
4. Very narrow one-off topics with low expected reuse.
